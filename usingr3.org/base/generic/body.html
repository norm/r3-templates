    The <body> of the page. 
        
    Ideally should contain any extra elements required to decorate the 
    entire body, but no other HTML. That should come in the various
    sections of the page included below.
    
    TODO: code to set the id and/or class on the body if required.

<body><div id='body-wrapper'>
<r3:include path="body_immediate.html" />
<r3:include path="body_masthead.html"  />
<r3:include path="body_crest.html"     />
<r3:include path="body_mainbody.html"  />
<r3:include path="body_footer.html"    />
<r3:include path="body_deferred.html"  />
</div></body>
