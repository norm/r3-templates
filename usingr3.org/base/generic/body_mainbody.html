    The main body of content on any given page. Articles, photos, etc.
    
    A common pattern seen across the web is to divide the main area into
    two (or more) columns, the first being primary content and the second
    (or others) being ancillary content, advertising and other less 
    important content.
    
    More columns/areas are best created by including more templates here
    (eg. "mainbody_tertiary.html").
